# Computer-Systems

<h2> 
Course information
Covers how programs are represented and executed by modern computers, including low-level machine representations of programs and data, an understanding of how computer components and the memory hierarchy influence performance.

Learning goals
Learning goals throughout the term: 

Explain and perform common logical operations (and, or, negation, conversion) on binary variables and binary vectors and identify and apply common boolean algebraic laws such as DeMorgan’s laws, idempotence, etc
An ability to translate between integer binary and decimal data, detect and identify the outcome of operations due to limited data representations (e.g. overflow), distinguish between the data representations and ranges for signed and unsigned data types
Translate IEEE floating point representation to and from binary and real numbers and identify the limitations of fixed-precision floating point representation.
An ability to related compiler-generated assembly programs to the corresponding higher level language structures with sufficient ability to enable debugging high level programs. Given a machine language representation of a program compiled in a higher level language, students should be identify and describe the operation of conditional statements, loops, function calls, switch statements.
The ability to explain how higher level language functions are implemented using the stack of an underlying machine, including how local variables are allocated, trace the execution due to recursion and identify and trace the effect of buffer-overflow of the stack.
An ability to explain how high level program structures can be restructured to facilitate optimization for pipelined architectures and cache memory hierarchies.
An ability to explain how computer memory is organized and represented both to the programmer and to the computer architecture by the operating system through the use of virtual memory mapping.
An understanding of how to use asynchronous signals, concurrent programs, and the programming issues that arise with such programs, such as race conditions.
Identify and construct processes on a common computer platform, identify and perform basic synchronization between processes, and understand the costs and benefits of using processes.
An ability to explain how global memory, function-local, and dynamic memory allocation is performed and the performance benefits of each form of memory allocation.
An ability to explain how programming errors may affect program correctness, including errors in function calls, memory allocation, integer, and floating point data representations. 
An ability to measure program performance and use that measured information to determine how to improve program performance. 
An ability to use a machine-level debugger and inspect the memory and register state of programs.

Grading Components 
The course has 4 grading components with the following breakdown:
Weekly quizzes  - 10% of grade
Four non-cumulative exams - 9% each, 36% of grade
Six programming labs - 50% of grade
Weekly lecture quizzes / participation - 4% of grade
Lab Assignments: Your primary assignments will be your “Lab Assignments,” given every 2-3 weeks, each of which will be followed by a grading meeting to review your solution with the instructor or TA. The labs are the primary learning vehicle for this course. The grade meetings are scheduled on the Moodle site typically just before the assignment is due, and will begin after the due date of each Lab. Even if you complete your work, you will not receive a grade unless you conduct a grading session. 

Students will be responsible for signing up for each interview grading no later than the interview grading period start date.

The grades for each lab will be based 40% upon the Task Success (i.e. “does it work”) and 60% upon your explanation of your code/assignment and answering questions about the lab and its concepts. Historically speaking, students that have completed the assignment themselves usually have a little problem passing the Q&A portion of the grade.  

Students may work in teams of up to two for the labs only, but each student will still be responsible for scheduling their own grading meeting with the TA for each lab.  You may help others only to the extent of answering typical questions that arise during compiling, debugging, and executing your lab assignments. 

All assignments are due by the deadline stated.  Extensions will not be granted except at the instructor’s discretion in cases of extreme hardship, emergency, etc. unless otherwise noted.

On the task success 40% portion of the grade, we strongly encourage you to submit even partially working code/assignment by the deadline to obtain partial credit on the 40% for task success.  
You must attend your grading meeting to qualify for grading points.  If you miss your meeting with the TA (without notifying your TA ahead of time with a suitable reason), this may result in a zero grade for the assignment.  The TA is under no obligation to reschedule your appointment if you miss your meeting, so write down your meeting times, and don’t forget them!  Even if you are unable to submit a fully working code/assignment by the deadline, we strongly encourage you to keep working at a full solution for the assignment, which should benefit your understanding and ability to answer questions during the Q&A meeting with the TA.
You must be able to explain every line of your code and answer any questions related to the topics covered by the homework. Not being able to answer those questions can result in a zero for the homework and other penalties. Having comments on each line of your code and reading the comments do not qualify for explaining the code, In those cases, the TA might ask you questions from your code to make sure it has been your own work.
All labs must be written in C and compiled for execution on the class programming environment unless otherwise noted.

Reading Quizzes: You will be assigned reading questions similar to the practice questions from the text. Most reading quizzes will be automatically graded and are designed to help you reify your knowledge of the material in a particular section of the book. You should also attempt the self-study questions in the book (answers at the end of the section).

Exams: You will have four proctored exams. The first two exams cover single chapters, each of which has significant material. The other two exams will cover multiple related chapters of material (see below).

Forum Discussion: Forum posts will appear on Moodle throughout the semester, and you will be responsible for participating in each discussion in a meaningful way.

Collaboration Policy
You are welcome and encouraged to work together in learning the material.

Cite Your Sources: If you worked with someone on an assignment, or if your submission includes quotes from a book, a paper, or a website, you should clearly acknowledge the source. Bottom line, feel free to use resources that are available to you as long as the use is reasonable and you cite them in your submission. However, copying answers directly or indirectly from solution manuals, web pages, or your peers is certainly unreasonable.

Inspiration is free: you may discuss homework assignments with anyone. You are especially encouraged to discuss solutions with your instructor and your classmates.

Plagiarism is forbidden: the assignments and code that you turn in should be written entirely on your own. You should not need to consult sources beyond your textbook, class notes, posted lecture slides and notebooks, programming language documentation, and online sources for basic techniques. Copying/soliciting a solution to a problem from the internet or another classmate constitutes a violation of the course’s collaboration policy and the honor code and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council.

Do not search for a solution online: You may not actively search for a solution to the problem from the internet. This includes posting to sources like StackOverflow, Reddit, Chegg, CourseHero, etc.

StackExchange Clarification: Searching for basic techniques in Python/C++ is totally fine. If you want to post and ask “How do I group by two columns, then do something, then group by a third column” that’s fine. What you shouldn’t do is post “Here’s the problem my prof gave me. Give me code!”. That’s cheating.

When in doubt, ask: We’ve tried to lay down some rules and the spirit of the collaboration policy above. However, we cannot be comprehensive. If you have doubts about this policy or would like to discuss specific cases, please ask the instructor. If it has not been described above, you should discuss it with us first.

Note: Other information on the Honor Code can be found at www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode. Collaboration boundaries are hard to define crisply and may differ from class to class. If you are in any doubt about where they lie for a particular course, it is your responsibility to ask the course instructor.
